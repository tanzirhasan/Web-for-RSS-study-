    <p>Topical corticosteroids (TCS) have been the mainstay of treatment for
    inflammatory dermatoses and are felt to be safe when used appropriately. In response to increased reports about Red Skin Syndrome (RSS) and Topical Steroid Addiction/Withdrawal (TSA/TSW), a systematic review (2015) conducted by the National Eczema Association concluded that RSS/TSA/TSW is a potential adverse effect of prolonged use of topical steroids. The phenomenon of RSS/TSA/TSW has been deemed rare. There is no validated definition, no patient registry, and no evidence-based treatment.

    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>An online survey of self-reported RSS/TSA/TSW-affected individuals was
        conducted between March 2014 and May 2015. The survey garnered 3840 adult
        responses, 2093 of whom started TCS as children. The survey included TCS user demographics, details of TCS usage, and severity and duration of symptoms after cessation of TCS. The survey consisted of 64 multiple choice, numeric value and open-ended questions. A <a href="#costex">COSTEX</a> (COrticoSTeroid EXposure) index was developed to quantify exposure reported by respondents. Data analysis and visualization followed.

    <header> <h3>Costex formula</h3></header>
        <p>To calculate the COSTEX index, the number of small tubes of each category were multiplied by the appropriate multiplier and then added together.

            <ul>
                    <li> 1 * number of small tubes non-prescription</li>
                    <li> 1.2 * number of small tubes Group 6</li>
                    <li> 1.4 * number of small tubes Group 5</li>
                    <li> 1.6 * number of small tubes Group 4</li>
                    <li> 1.8 * number of small tubes Group 3</li>
                    <li> 2.0 * number of small tubes Group 2</li>
                    <li> 2.2 * number of small tubes Group 1</li>
             </ul>
            Ex: costex <- 1 * x1 + 1.2 * x2 +1.4 * x3 + 1.6 * x4 + 1.8 * x5 + 2.0 * x6 + 2.2 * x7

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Of those respondents who detailed their symptoms, 81% reported moderate to severe intense itching (level 2-3). 77% also reported moderate to severe red burning skin and 69% reported moderate to severe raw painful skin. Younger age of starting TCS (spearman r = -0.26, p = 1.185e-08), longer duration of exposure (p = 5.985e-16), and greater quantity of exposure (p < 2.2e-16) were associated with more severe symptomatology. Higher COSTEX index was associated with longer duration of symptoms. Adults with highest COSTEX index reported the highest itch severity. A trend was observed that intense pruritus worsened for about 1.5 years after discontinuing TCS before improvement was reported. Symptomatology after stopping TCS was prolonged in many cases. Of 31 respondents who reported having stopped TCS for 5+ years, 26% reported that symptoms still persisted. There was a small (r = 0.27) but highly significant (p < .0005) correlation between duration of symptoms and COSTEX.
    </p>
    <h3>Summary & Future Directions</h3>
    <p>Large numbers of patients who have used topical corticosteroids believe they have symptoms related to their use. In this cohort the symptoms were reported as severe and persistent. As previously reported, longer duration and intensity of use of TCS is significantly associated with more severe and prolonged symptomatology. Further study is needed to arrive at an accurate definition, diagnostic criteria, and prevention and treatment strategies for RSS/TSA/TSW.
